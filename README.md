### Working without the VS Code CLI
This containerized environment cannot download or run Microsoft's official
`code` binary, which previously caused a `command not found` error when trying
to launch Visual Studio Code from the terminal. To surface more helpful
guidance we now ship a small shim at `bin/code` that explains alternatives for
opening the project in VS Code.

To use it, add the repository's `bin` directory to your `PATH` in the current
shell session:

```bash
export PATH="$(pwd)/bin:$PATH"
```

Running `code` (or `code --help`) afterwards will display a message detailing
options such as using [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev), connecting through VS
Code Remote Tunnels, or cloning the repository locally where the real CLI is
available.
