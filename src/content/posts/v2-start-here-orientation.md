Welcome to SurviveTheAI V2. This orientation packs everything you need to get value fast:

1) A map of the new versioned layout and why posts are split by version.  
2) The core playbooks to read first.  
3) Where to track updates, drops, and experiments.  
4) How to share feedback so we can iterate faster.

Follow this first, then jump into the featured and evergreen posts — you’ll have context for everything else.
