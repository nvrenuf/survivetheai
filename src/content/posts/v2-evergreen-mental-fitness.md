Mental fitness is a skill — and the noise of AI hype makes it harder. This evergreen routine keeps you steady:

- **Morning reset (10 min):** breathwork + quick journaling to reset focus.
- **Information diet:** cap doomscrolling; batch check feeds once per day.
- **Single-tasking blocks:** 45–60 minute deep work intervals with analog notes.
- **Detox:** one no-screen hour before bed to downshift.
