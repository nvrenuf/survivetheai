The AI wave is accelerating — and so is the turbulence it creates for teams, careers, and mental health.

This V2 featured guide distills the tactics we’ve seen work across tech, operations, and creative teams:

1. Ship in smaller increments with clearer experiments.
2. Pair AI copilots with human reviewers for critical work.
3. Move your portfolio to a cadence you can sustain weekly.
4. Build redundancy into income streams to handle shocks.

Use this as your anchor: a crisp checklist you can revisit when everything else feels noisy.
