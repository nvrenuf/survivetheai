# Don’t Get Replaced: Pick the AI Study Platform That Builds the Right Skills

> **If you don’t control the tools, the tools will control you.**

<div class="callout">
	<strong>TL;DR:</strong> AI tools can speed you up but can also make you dependent. Pick by skill gap. Run the 14-day test.

## TL;DR
- AI study tools can make you fast, but also dependent.
- Don’t pick by brand. **Pick by the skill you must build.**
- Use the guide below to match **your skill gap → the right platform**.
- Run the **14‑day test** to prove you can perform **without** the tool.

---

## Why this matters
AI is changing work. People who **learn the right skills** keep their jobs and get raises. People who learn only to **press “generate”** get replaced. This guide helps you choose a tool that trains your brain, not just your thumbs.

---

## Find your skill gap
Circle 1–2 gaps you must fix next:

- Reasoning: break down problems, explain steps  
- Writing: turn ideas into clear drafts fast  
- Code/Math: follow logic, debug, show work  
- Foundations: basic concepts for school or reskilling  
- Speed help: quick walkthroughs under time pressure

## Match your gap to the right platform

> Rule: **If it feels too easy for too long, it’s not building skill.**

| Your goal | Use this | Why it fits | Watch out |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Reasoning depth** | **Claude (Extended Thinking)** | Pushes you to explain steps and defend choices | Slower on purpose. Stay with it. |
| **Turn ideas into drafts** | **ChatGPT (Study Mode)** | Great sparring partner for outlines and edits | Don’t let it write everything. You decide. |
| **Code or math clarity** | **Gemini (Guided Learning / LearnLM)** | Clear step‑by‑step logic and debugging | Don’t skip to the answer. Show your work. |
| **Foundations (K‑12, basics)** | **Khanmigo** | Mastery practice with guardrails | Narrow scope. Use others as you advance. |
| **Quick homework help** | **QANDA** | Fast walkthroughs and solutions | High dependency risk. Use lightly. |
| **Casual learning only** | **Grok** | Light summaries and context | Not for deep skill. Don’t rely on it. |

## Platform briefings: what each does best

### ChatGPT — Study Mode
**Best at:** turning ideas into drafts, guided questions, critique.  
**Great for tasks:**  
- Build an outline, then expand to a draft  
- Rewrite emails, briefs, landing pages  
- Create study plans, checklists, interview prep  
- Role‑play customer or manager questions to stress‑test ideas  
**Jobs/industries:** Marketing, content, sales, product, HR/comms, founders, educators.  
**Training & resources:** In‑app tips, example prompts, short “how to” guides.  
**Common trap:** Letting it write the whole thing. You stop thinking.  
**Pro tip:** You write first. Ask ChatGPT to **critique** and **push back** before it edits.

---

### Claude — Extended Thinking
**Best at:** deep reasoning, long answers, clear step‑by‑step logic.  
**Great for tasks:**  
- Threat models, incident timelines, policy reviews  
- Research summaries with sources and assumptions  
- Long RFP answers, audit walkthroughs, design decisions  
- “Explain like I’m new” breakdowns of complex topics  
**Jobs/industries:** Security, risk, compliance, legal ops, consulting, research, technical writing, strategy.  
**Training & resources:** Example prompts, usage guides, API docs for structured workflows.  
**Common trap:** Quitting because it feels slower. That “friction” is where you grow.  
**Pro tip:** Ask Claude to **challenge your assumptions** and **show the chain of reasoning at a high level**. You defend each step.

---

### Gemini — Guided Learning / LearnLM
**Best at:** code/math step‑through, debugging, “show your work.”  
**Great for tasks:**  
- Explain a failing test and fix it, step by step  
- Build SQL queries and check edge cases  
- Translate formulas across Sheets/Excel  
- Walk through data pipelines and simple ML exercises  
**Jobs/industries:** Software/devops, data analysis, finance ops, ops analysts, STEM students, IT help desks.  
**Training & resources:** Tutorials, codelab‑style walkthroughs, Workspace/Classroom tie‑ins.  
**Common trap:** Copying the fix without learning the pattern.  
**Pro tip:** After a walkthrough, **rebuild from scratch** without hints. Then ask Gemini to grade your steps.

---

### Khanmigo
**Best at:** safe, structured practice and mastery for basics (K‑12 and adult refresh).  
**Great for tasks:**  
- Math practice with hints that don’t spoil the answer  
- Reading comprehension and writing basics  
- AP/standardized test prep with progress tracking  
**Jobs/industries:** Teachers, tutors, parents, homeschool, adults restarting core math/reading.  
**Training & resources:** Teacher dashboards, lesson plans, unit guides.  
**Common trap:** Staying here too long after basics.  
**Pro tip:** Use Khanmigo to **master basics**, then graduate to ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini for real‑world work.

---

### QANDA
**Best at:** fast help for a single problem under time pressure.  
**Great for tasks:**  
- Scan a math problem → get steps and similar examples  
- Quick science explanations  
- Rapid review before a test  
**Jobs/industries:** Students, cram schools, after‑school programs.  
**Training & resources:** In‑app tutorials and examples.  
**Common trap:** Using it daily as a crutch.  
**Pro tip:** Treat it like a **calculator**: allowed sometimes, never the main teacher.

---

### Grok
**Best at:** quick context, trending info, light study tied to social feeds.  
**Great for tasks:**  
- Summarize a topic, trends, or a long thread  
- Gather a fast reading list  
- Draft light notes for a meeting  
**Jobs/industries:** Media, social/community managers, general awareness.  
**Training & resources:** Basic help center articles.  
**Common trap:** Thinking quick summaries equal real skill.  
**Pro tip:** Use Grok to **scan**, then switch to Claude/Gemini/ChatGPT for **doing**.

## Build a simple “learning stack”
Use **one** tool for deep work and **one** for speed. Add a third only if needed.

<figure class="figure-narrow">
	<img
		src="/images/cognitive-survival-stack.png"
		alt="Cognitive Survival Stack"
		class="img-medium"
		width="1200" height="800"
		loading="lazy" decoding="async"
		sizes="(min-width:1024px) 768px, 100vw"
	/>
	<figcaption class="figcap">Pick tools by the mental muscle they build.</figcaption>
</figure>

- **Suffering Engine** → **Claude** for hard reasoning.  
- **Sparring Partner** → **ChatGPT** for idea fights and polish.  
- **Specialist** → **Gemini** for stepwise code/math.  
- **Trainer Mode** → **Khanmigo** for basics and practice.  
- **Utility Layer** → **QANDA** for quick lookups only.

Keep it small. Depth first. Add tools later.

---

## The 14‑day skill test (keep what works)
- **Days 1–3 — Learn.** Study one topic with your chosen tool.  
- **Day 4 — Go dark.** Explain it **without** any AI.  
- **Days 5–7 — Switch.** Learn the same topic with a second tool. Compare.  
- **Day 10 — Invert.** You write the answer; the AI only **critiques**.  
- **Day 14 — Decide.** Which tool left you stronger **without** it? Keep that.

> If you can’t perform without the tool, the tool is training you for replacement.

---

## Final check before you commit
Ask yourself:  
1) Can I do the core task **solo**?  
2) Do I know **why** each step is right?  
3) After two weeks, am I **less** dependent on the tool?

If not, change tools or change your stack.
